Topic: FlightPath Overview
Myna FlightPath is a Model-View-Controller(MVC) web application framework inspired by 
CakePHP, CFWheels and Ruby On Rails. 

Before you begin:
* What is MVC? http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller
* What is CoC? (convention over configuration)? http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration

Myna FlightPath is an application template that implements much of the 
infrastructure web developers typically have to create to start working on a web 
application. This allows you to write your business logic as plain JavaScript 
functions, your displays as EJS templates, and have your data objects 
automatically generated from the database, nearly eliminating the need to write 
SQL.

FlightPath Features:
	MVC framework - Strong separation of data, business logic and display.Each
		of these can be manipulated independent of the others. 
		
	Automatic model generation - 	If your application has a single datasource, 
		FlightPath will create models for that datasource automatically, just when 
		needed. FlightPath will also analyze foreign key relationships and create 
		related models. Data type constraints are also analyzed and become 
		validators. See: <Model>
		
	URL "routes"	-	It is possible with FlightPath to map virtually any URL to 
		an action. "appdir/book/get/12", "appdir/mypage.html", 
		"appdir/index.sjs?controller=test&action=run" are all valid URLs. An 
		action can even have multiple routes assigned to it. 
		
	Ext.Direct support	-	FlightPath provides a builtin-in controller to handle 
		Ext.Direct API calls. See: <Controller: Direct>
		
	Authentication and authorization	-	FlightPath comes with an optional 
		permissions behavior that can secure individual controllers or whole 
		applications. See: <Behavior: MynaAuth>

Topic: Glossary
	Terms used when talking about Myna FlightPath Applications
	
	Terms:
		$flash			-	Global temporary message store. Intended for displaying 
							messages to the user regardless of which action will 
							be next loaded. Used by <$FP.redirectTo> and the default 
							_Layout_. See: <$flash>
							
		$FP				-	Global FlightPath object that contains functions 
							accessible from everywhere in a FlightPath application. See: <$FP>
							
		Action			-	A function on a _Controller_ that takes input from a 
							web request, sets data on the controller instance, 
							and picks a _View_ to render the data back to the 
							browser.
		bean			-	An instance of a _beanClass_. Represents a single object 
							from a <Model> data store. 
		beanClass	-	A class associated with a Model that represents a "row" of 
							data from that model. This class contains functions for 
							getting and setting values, validating values, field metadata, 
							etc. Also contains liks to related _beans_ from related <models> 					
		Behavior		-	A mixin class that overrides, alters, or appends 
							functionality to a class. Behaviors can be applied to
							either _Controllers_ or _Models_. See: <Behaviors>
							
		camelCase		-	name format where all words are lower case, first letter 
							of each word after the first capitalized, with no 
							separation. ex: employeeAction
		
		Controller		-	Refers to either a <Controller> class or instance. 
							Controllers contain _Actions_ manage _Layouts_, an 
							contain _Behaviors_, and _Filters_
							
		Element			-	Specialized _View_ template for containing output 
							snippets to be included in a _View_
							
		Filter			-	A function applied in the init() function of a 
							Controller to be executed before or after an _Action_. 
							This can be used to alter how actions are performed 
							without changing the actions themselves. For example 
							authentication and permissions checks can be 
							performed in filters and certain actions can be 
							denied or audited. See: <Controller.addFilter>
							
		file_case		- a name format where all words are lower case, and 
							separated by underbars(_). ex: employee_action
		
		Helpers			-	Helpers are function libraries used inside of 
							_Views_ and _Actions_ for repetitive tasks, usually 
							related to generating output. See: <$FP.helpers.Html>
							
		Layout			-	Specialized _View_ template set in a _Controller_ to 
							wrap content created by an _Action_, See: Layouts
							
		Model			-	Refers to either a <Model> class or instance. Models 
							in FlightPath are static singletons (Only one 
							instance per request). Model Functions can return 
							one or more <beanClass> instances that contain 
							the actual model data
							
		ProperCase	-	 name format where all words are lower case, first letter 
							capitalized with no separation. ex: EmployeeAction
							
		Route			-	A URL pattern that maps to a controller an d action. 
							A FlightPath application can support multiple routes. 
							See: <Routes>
							
		url-case		- a name format where all words are lower case, and 
							separated by underbars(_) or dashs(-). ex: employee-action, employee_action
							
		View			-	An .ejs template intended to be sent to the browser.
							There are also specialized views: <Layouts> and <Elements>
		
		
		
		
		
Topic: Getting Started
	To create a FlightPath template, navigate to the Myna Administrator and select  
	"Add/Update FlightPath App", and enter a path and folder name, relative to the Myna 
	web root. If this directory does not exist, it will be created. Once The FlightPath
	template has been unpacked you will see a directory structure like this:
	
	
	(code)
	  +-application.sjs
	  +-app/
	  	+...
	  +-framework/
	  	+...
	(end)
	
	The "framework" folder contains the FlightPath framework code. These files 
	will be overwritten future uses of the "Add/Update FlightPath App" feature.
	Here you will find built-in controllers and behaviors such as 
	<Controller: Direct> and <Behavior: MynaAuth>. You should not 
	modify any files in this folder.
	
	"application.sjs" is a standard Myna application definition (See: <$application>),
	With custom "config" section specific to FlightPath (See: <FlightPath Config>) 
	
	The "app" folder contains your application. These files will not be altered by 
	future uses of the "Add/Update FlightPath App" feature.
	
	(code)                                   
	+-app/
		+-behaviors/                                       
		| +-controllers/                                   
		| \-models/
		+-controllers/
		| \-global.sjs 
		+-models/
		| \-global.sjs 
		+-modules/                 
		+-static/                       
		\-views/
		  +-elements/
		  +-home.ejs                                 
		  +-layouts/
		  | \-default.ejs
		  \-themes/
	(end)
	
	"app" sub-folders:
		behaviors		-	Stores <Controller> behaviors in the "controllers" folder
							and <Model> behaviors in the "model" folder. See <Behaviors>
		controllers		-	Stores <Controller> files. File names should be lower case 
							with underbars (_) between words and "_controller" on the end, 
							e.g. MyItem becomes my_item_controller.sjs. The global.sjs 
							file is included before every controller file. Use this file 
							for global initialization and/or to add common functions to 
							all controllers. The init() in the global.sjs file is executed 
							before the controller's init()
		models			-	Stores <Model> files. File names should be lower case 
							with underbars (_) between words and "_model" on the end, 
							e.g. MyItem becomes my_item_model.sjs. The global.sjs 
							file is included before every model file. Use this file 
							for global initialization and/or to add common functions to 
							all models. The init() in the global.sjs file is executed 
							before the model's init()
		modules			-	Modules are self-contained FlightPath applications that can be embedded in 
							other applications. These controllers, models and views can be accessed as 
							if they were in the main application. See: <Modules>
		static			-	This folder contains static content that will not be interpreted as Myna or 
							FlightPath code. These files are accessed via http://server.tld/appname/static/filename
							This is a good place for images, client-side JavaScript files and css files
		views				-	This folder contains a sub-folder for each controller that has views. For example
							the view for the Main controller's index() action would be views/main/index.ejs
		views/home.ejs	-	default page loaded if no homeRoute is defined (see: <FlightPath Config>)
		views/elements	-	This folder contains any _Elements_ defined for the app
		views/layouts	-	This folder contains any _Layouts_ defined for the app, including the global layout.
								This folder may also contain sub-folders by controller name. 
		views/layouts	-	reserved for future use					

	Hello World!:
	First, let's edit our application.sjs file and disable our default datasource,
	for now
	(code)
		// in application.sjs
		...
		config:{
			ds:{
				//"default":"flight_path_app"
			},
		...
	(end)
	You should probably edit the appname and other metadata properties while you are here
	
	Let's create a Main controller and an index() action:
	(code)
		// in app/controllers/main_controller.sjs
		
		function index(){
			this.renderContent("Hello World!")
		}
	(end)
	
	You can now access this via  /yourapp/
	
	This works because the default route (See: <FlightPath Config>) is set to 
	Main.index. The full URL would be /yourapp/main/index
	
	This is fine for a single line of text, but it is not very flexible for HTML. 
	Lets add a view:
	
	(code)
		// in app/controllers/main_controller.sjs
		
		function index(){
			this.set("text","Hello World!");
		}
	(end)
	(code)
		<%-- in app/views/main/main_index.ejs --%>
		<h1><%=text%></h1>
	(end)
	
	In our controller we set some data that then appears as a global variable in 
	our view. If you view source on this page you'll see something like this:
	(code)
		<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
		<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
		<head>
			<meta name="description" content="" />
			<meta name="keywords" content="" />
			<title>Main.index</title>
			<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/dev/favicon.ico" >
			<script type="text/javascript" src="/dev/shared/js/libOO/client.sjs"></script>
		</head>
		<body>
		<div class="flash_message_container">
		</div>
		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
		</body>
		</html>
	(end)
	
	All that extra HTML wrapping your view is coming from the default layout in 
	app/views/layouts/default.ejs. Unless you make a call to <Controller.setLayout>
	all views in your app will be wrapped in this layout. You can manipulate the 
	metadata in this layout by setting properties on <Controller.$page>. Let's 
	set a title for our page.
	
	(code)
		// in app/controllers/main_controller.sjs
		
		function index(){
			this.$page.title = "Howdy"
			this.set("text","Hello World!");
		}
	(end)
	
	
	Working with databases:
	That's entertaining, but it would be nice to work with some actual data. 
	Let's create a database to work with
	
	(code)
		// in application.sjs
		...
		config:{
			ds:{
				"default":"fp_app"
			}
			...
		}
		...
		onRequestStart:function(){ // run directly before requested file
			if (!Myna.Admin.ds.exists("fp_app")){
				Myna.Admin.ds.createLocalDatabase("fp_app")
				var db = new Myna.Database("fp_app");
				db.getTable("authors").create({
					recreate:true,
					columns:[{
						name:"id",
						isPrimaryKey:true,
						type:"VARCHAR",
						maxLength:255,
						allowNull:false,
					},{
						name:"name",
						type:"VARCHAR",
						maxLength:255,
						
					}]
				});
				
				db.getTable("posts").create({
					recreate:true,
					columns:[{
						name:"id",
						isPrimaryKey:true,
						type:"VARCHAR",
						maxLength:255,
						allowNull:false,
					},{
						name:"slug",
						type:"VARCHAR",
						maxLength:255,
						
					},{
						name:"created",
						type:"DATE",
					},{
						name:"author_id",
						type:"VARCHAR",
						maxLength:255,
						references:{
							table:"authors",
							column:"id",
							onDelete:"cascade",
							onUpdate:"cascade",
						}
					}]
				});
				
				db.getTable("post_contents").create({
					recreate:true,
					columns:[{
						name:"id",
						isPrimaryKey:true,
						type:"VARCHAR",
						maxLength:255,
						allowNull:false,
					},{
						name:"post_id",
						type:"VARCHAR",
						maxLength:255,
						references:{
							table:"posts",
							column:"id",
							onDelete:"cascade",
							onUpdate:"cascade",
						}
					},{
						name:"content",
						type:"TEXT"
					}]
				});
				
				db.getTable("tags").create({
					recreate:true,
					columns:[{
						name:"id",
						isPrimaryKey:true,
						type:"VARCHAR",
						maxLength:255,
						allowNull:false,
					},{
						name:"tag_name",
						type:"VARCHAR",
						maxLength:255,
					}]
				});
				
				db.getTable("posts_tags").create({
					recreate:true,
					columns:[{
						name:"post_id",
						type:"VARCHAR",
						maxLength:255,
						allowNull:false,
					},{
						name:"tag_id",
						type:"VARCHAR",
						maxLength:255,
						allowNull:false,
					}]
				});
				
				
				
			}
			
			var frameworkFolder=this.config.frameworkFolder||this.dir + "framework" 
			Myna.include(frameworkFolder+"/FlightPath.sjs",{}).init().handleRequest();
		}
		...
	(end)
	This creates a local database with some example tables for a blog application.
	Have a look at <Myna.Admin>, <Myna.Database> and <Myna.Table> for more details. 
	If you were including this in a real application, you might limit it to 
	development environments or at least move it to onApplicationStart which runs 
	less often.
	
	Notice that the names are plural, and the primary and foreign keys are 
	defined. This is important for the <Models> to properly auto generate 
	(See: <Model.Model Conventions>). 
	
	Creating a post editor:
	Lets create a way to edit our posts.
	
	(code)
		//in app/controllers/post_controller.sjs
		function edit(params){
			// Generate ID for new record if none-supplied. That way ID will be in 
			// the URL and refreshing the page won't create a new record
			if (!params.id){
				$FP.redirectTo({
					id:this.model.genKey()
				})
			}
			
			// only get here if not re-directed
			this.set("bean",this.model.get(params));
		}
	(end)
	Here we're creating an "edit" action that can be used for both new posts and 
	existing posts. New posts will generate a unique key that will be used when
	the post is saved. If you looks at <ManagerObject.genKey>, you will see that 
	for tables with a varchar primary key, the default key generator outputs UUID's.
	This can be overridden in <Model> definitions. See <$FP.redirectTo> for how 
	redirects work. 
	
	Finally, we set a local "bean" property with the result of 
	"this.model.get(params)" (See: <Model.get>). This creates a temporary _bean_ 
	that contains either the data of an existing _bean_, or the default values for 
	a new _bean_ 
	
	Now we need a view to display it:
	(code)
		<%-- in app/views/post/post_edit.ejs --%>
		
		<form action="<%=Html.url({action:"save",id:bean.id})%>" method="post"> 
			<table width="100%" height="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" >
				<tr>
					<th ><%=bean.getLabel("id")%>:</th><td><%=bean.id%>, <%=bean.getLabel("created")%>: <%=bean.get_created()%><td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th><%=bean.getLabel("slug")%>:</th>
					<td><input name="slug" value="<%=String(bean.get_slug()||"")%>"><td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th><%=bean.Author().getLabel("name")%>:</th>
					<td><input name="Author.name" value="<%=String(bean.Author().name||"")%>"><td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th colspan="2" align="left"><%=bean.PostContent().getLabel("content")%>:</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2" align="left">
						<textarea cols="70" rows="50" name="PostContent.content"><%=String(bean.PostContent().content||"")%></textarea>
					<td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2" align="right">
						<button type="submit">Save</button>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</form>
	(end)
	
	Note the form action. Here we are using the Html helper 
	(see: <$FP.helpers.Html>) to make a URL for our "save" action. Next, note 
	that the "bean" property we set in the action is now a global variable in the 
	view (See: <Views>). We're using <Model.beanClass.getLabel> to get a label for 
	each field. This allows for centralized field name definition in Model files, 
	and potentially even international language translation. 
	
	The bean's getters (get_created, get_slug, etc) will return either the current 
	value or the default value defined in the Model file, depending on whether 
	this is a new or an existing record.
	
	Notice the line containing "bean.Author()". This is accessing the related 
	parent author bean. Myna knows that Posts belongTo Authors because of the 
	foreign key defined on the posts table. If this is a new post then there will 
	not be an associated parent Author record. In this case a new parent record 
	will be created. Normally you would probably want to have a <select> here and 
	have a separate Author controller manage Author records. On the next line, 
	notice that the name for the input field is "Author.name". Myna recognizes 
	structure and array notation in query variables and attempts to reconstruct 
	complex objects from them (See: <$req.data> and <Object.setByPath>) This 
	means that the "params" object passed the "save" action will have an Author 
	object with a "name" property. Because the Post model knows that it belongsTo 
	Author, it will automatically create or load the related Author record and set 
	its "name" property. More on that when we get to save()
	
	Notice that we are doing something similar with PostContent. Because the 
	post_contents table has a foreign key to posts, the Post model knows it 
	potentially has a "hasMany" or "hasOne" relationship with post_contents. 
	By using "PostContent.content" we are using the "hasOne" relationship to 
	create a content row and associate it with this post. 
	
	Ok, now we need to write a "save" action:
	
	(code)
		// in app/controllers/post_controller.sjs
		...		
		function save(params){
			var bean = this.model.get(params);
			var validation = bean.save();
			
			if (validation.success) {
				$FP.redirectTo({
					action:"index",
					success:"Record Saved." 
				})
			} else {
				$FP.redirectTo({
					action:"edit",
					id:bean.id,
					error:validation
				})
			}
		}
	(end)
	
	Here we create a temporary bean via <Model.get> and the attempt to save it
	via <Model.beanClass.save>, which returns a <Myna.ValidationResult>. If 
	successful we redirect to the index page, otherwise back to the edit page. 
	The extra parameters to redirectTo ("success" and "error") are converted into 
	<$flash> messages and displayed via the default layout

	All that is left now is to make the index page to display our posts

	(code)
		// in app/controllers/post_controller.sjs
		...		
		function index(params){
			//this will pass paging info from params to the underlying query
			params.setDefaultProperties({
				page:1,
				pageSize:25
			})
			this.set("rows",this.model.findBeans({},params))
		}
	(end)
	
	(code)
		<%-- in app/views/post/post_index.ejs --%>
		
		<%=Html.link({
			action:"edit",
			text:"Add Post"
		})%>
		<table width="100%" height="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" >
			<tr>
				<th><%=$controller.model.getLabel("id")%></th>
				<th><%=$controller.model.getLabel("slug")%></th>
				<th><%=$controller.model.getLabel("created")%></th>
				<th><%=$controller.model.Author.getLabel("name")%></th>
			</tr>
			<@loop array="rows" element="bean" index="i">
				<tr>
					<td>
						<%=Html.link({
							action:"edit",
							id:bean.id,
							text:bean.id
						})%>
					</td>
					<td><%=bean.get_slug()%></td>
					<td><%=bean.get_created().format("m/d/Y H:i:s")%></td>
					<td><%=bean.Author().get_name()%></td>
				</tr>
			</@loop>
		</table>
		<table width="100%" height="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" >
			<tr>
				<td nowrap>
					<@if $params.page != 1>
						<%=Html.link({
							params:{
								page:parseInt($params.page)-1
							},
							text:"&lt;&lt; previous page"
						})%>				
					</@if>
				</td>
				<td width="100%">&nbsp;</td>
				<td nowrap>
					<@if rows.length == $params.pageSize>
						<%=Html.link({
							params:{
								page:parseInt($params.page)+1
							},
							text:"next page >>"
						})%>				
					</@if>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
	(end)
	
	Now we can page through our results and add new posts.

Topic: FlightPath Config
	FlightPath configuration is stored in the "config" property of $application.

	Here is the default FlightPath config
	(code)
	//--------- FlightPath config -----------------------------------------
		config:{
			ds:{
				"default":"flight_path_app"
			},
			homeRoute:{
				controller:"Main",
				action:"index"
			},
			routes:[{
				name:"pages",
				pattern:"page/$page*",
				controller:"page",
				action:"display",
				page:"$page"
			},{
				name:"default",
				pattern:"$controller/$action/$id/$restParams*",
				controller:"$controller",
				action:"$action",
				id:"$id"
				restParams:"$restParams"
			}],
			//frameworkFolder:"file:/home/mark/myna/web/shared/js/FlightPath/framework",
			MyCustomProperty:"woot!"
		},
	(end)
	
	"ds":
	This structure lists data sources and their manager aliases, where the property 
	is the alias, and the value is the DS name. Normally you only 
	need the default data source. However, if you need access to models from multiple 
	data sources, list them here. Note that you also need to set the manager property 
	of the model to match the manager alias defined here, for any models beyond the 
	default model/DS
	
	"homeRoute":
	Defines the default route the will be executed when no url is provided, 
	i.e. "http/server.tld/appname/". This structure should include everything that 
	should be passed as "params" to the action 
	
	"routes":
	Defines what routes are available in this app. See: <Routes>
	
	"frameworkFolder":
	Defaults to "framework". This is the <MynaPath> to where the framework 
	folder is located. Setting this to a central location will allow all 
	FlightPath apps to share these files and be upgraded at once. Using the 
	example path of "file:/home/mark/myna/web/shared/js/FlightPath/framework" 
	will cause the app to always use the version of the FlightPath framework 
	included with the server. When Myna is upgraded, this folder is as well. 
	
	"MyCustomProperty":
	All properties in the config will be applied to <$FP> and are available there from
	any model, controller or view
	
	
Topic: Behaviors
	Behaviors are functions that are applied to the current object. 
	
	Behaviors can be applied to either models or controllers to modify their 
	functionality. If you want to add a set of functions multiple controllers or 
	models behaviors are a good mechanism.
	
	* Built-in controller behaviors are stored in framework/behaviors/controllers/<behavior name>.sjs
	* Custom controller behaviors are stored in app/behaviors/controllers/<behavior name>.sjs
	* Built-in model behaviors are stored in framework/behaviors/models/<behavior name>.sjs
	* Custom model behaviors are stored in app/behaviors/models/<behavior name>.sjs
	
	In the case of a name conflict, custom behaviors hide built-in behaviors
	
	Example:
	(code)
		//in some_controller.sjs
		function init(){
			// loads the built-in PDF andJSON filters
			// Each of these has an "init" function that adds the appropriate 
			// before and after filters
			this.applyBehavior([
				"FormatPdf",
				"FormatJson"
			]);
			
			//loads a single behavior with options
			this.applyBehavior("MynaAuth",{
				whitelist:[
					"Main.index",
					"Main.logout"
				],
				redirectParams:{
					message: "Enter your AD domain credentials",
					providers:["ldap_ad"]
				}
			});
		}
	(end)
	
	See:
	* <Controller.applyBehavior>
	* <Model.applyBehavior>

Topic: Elements
	An element file is a specialized view (see: <Views>) that is intended to contain 
	a fragment of output (usually HTML) that can be used in a view 
	
	
	Element Locations:
	* app/views/elements/<name>.ejs,
	* app/views/elements/<controller name>/<name>.ejs
	
	(code)
		//in app/views/test/index.ejs
		
		<%=getElement("shared/common_commonlinks.ejs")%>
		<%=getElement()%>
	(end)
	
	See:

Topic: Layouts
	A layout file is a specialized view (see: <Views>) that is intended to wrap content before 
	sending it to the browser. 
	
	
	Layout Locations:
		Global Default		-	app/views/layouts/default.ejs
		Controller Default	-	app/views/layouts/<controller name>/default.ejs
		General Layouts		-	app/views/layouts/<layout name>.ejs
		
	General layouts are stored in app/views/layouts/<layout name>.ejs. 
	The global default layout is stioreController default layouts are store 
	Layouts are applied by calling <Controller.addLayout> or <Controller.setLayout>  
	
	Layouts can wrap other layouts. For example the global default layout wraps the controller 
	Layouts are layered like so:
	(code)
		/app/views/layouts/default.ejs wraps
			/app/views/layouts/controllername/default.ejs wraps
				/app/views/controllername/actionname.ejs
	(end)
	
	Calling this function adds additional layouts that wrap the view, like so:
	
	(code)
		function init(){
			this.addLayout("mylayout1")
			this.addLayout("otherController/mylayout2.ejs")
		}
		
	//results in 
	/app/views/layouts/default.ejs wraps
		/app/views/layouts/controllername/default.ejs wraps
			/app/views/layouts/mylayout1.ejs wraps
				/app/views/layouts/otherController/mylayout2.ejs wraps
					/app/views/controllername/actionname.ejs	
		
	(end)	
	
Topic: Modules
	Modules are self-contained FlightPath applications that can be embedded in 
	other applications. These controllers, models and views can be accessed as 
	if they were in the main application. 
	
	A module can be created from a FlightPath application by copying its "app" 
	folder to the new application's "app/modules" folder and then renaming it to 
	the module name. Then all folders except "models", "controllers" and "views"
	should be removed. Local models, controllers and views are always found before
	module models, controllers and views, so published modules should have names 
	that are unique for these objects. 
	
Topic: Routes
	Routes are URL patterns that can be mapped to controllers and actions. Routes 
	are defined in the config section of the application.sjs for your app 
	(See: <FlightPath Config>). An incoming URL is matched against the routes 
	array from top to bottom, exiting early if a match is found
	
	Route Parameters:
		name		-	name of the route. This is used by <$FP.helpers.Html.url> and 
						<$FP.helpers.Html.link> to create URL's that match a particular
						route.
		pattern		-	String. Pattern to match. see *Pattern Definitions* below
		controller	-	String. Either the URL name of a controller or the placeholder
						variable that should contain the controller name
		action		-	String. Either the URL name of an action or the placeholder
						variable that should contain the action name
		id			-	*Optional* String. Either a hard-coded id value or the 
						placeholder variable that should contain the id
		<other>		-	*Optional* any other properties will become parameters 
						to the action. Value can be a literal or a placeholder variable						
		

	Pattern Definitions:
	Patterns are a series of tokens separated by slashes(/). tokens can be:
	
	String literals										-	  "page", 
	Variable placeholders								-	 "$page"
	Globbing variable placeholders (must be last token)	-	 "$page*"
	Regular expressions									-	 "rpt\\d+\\.\\w{3}"
	Regular expression variable placeholders			-	 "$report(rpt\\d+\\.\\w{3})"
	Request method prefix (only before first token) 	-	"[GET]<first token>/<next token...>"
	Request method prefix variable placeholder (before first token) -  "[$method]<first token>/<next token...>"
	
	Examples:
	The URL is examined from left to right matching URL tokens to route tokens.
	
	*Literal tokens* are matched as if they were lower case 
	
	(code)
		name:"home",
        pattern:"index.html",
        controller:"main",
        action:"index"
        /*
			"server.tld/<appname>/index.html"
				controller:"main",
				action:"index"
        */
	(end)
	
	*Variable placeholders* start with $ and can only consist of letters, numbers 
	and the underbar (_). Variable placeholders capture the token in the URL at 
	the position where they appear and assign that value to the route property 
	that has the same value as the placeholder.
	
	(code)
		name:"emp",
        pattern:"emp/$empnum",
        controller:"emp",
        action:"display",
        id:"$empnum"
        /*
			"server.tld/<appname>/emp/22045563"
				controller:"emp",
				action:"display",
				id:"22045563"
        */
	(end)
		
	
	*Globbing variable placeholders* capture the rest of the URL, including slashes(/)
	
	(code)
		name:"pages",
        pattern:"page/$page*",
        controller:"page",
        action:"display",
        page:"$page"
        /*
			"server.tld/<appname>/page/archive/2011/dec/christmas-party"
				controller:"page",
				action:"display",
				page:"archive/2011/dec/christmas-party"
        */
	(end)
	
	*Regular expressions* need to be matched but don't capture. Note that they 
	still only match one token
	
	(code)
		name:"deleted",
        pattern:"oldstuff/.*",
        controller:"deleted",
        action:"error-deleted-content",
        /*
			"server.tld/<appname>/oldstuff/some-random-file.xls"
				controller:"deleted",
				action:"error-deleted-content",
        */
	(end)
	
	*Regular expression variable placeholders* capture the matched token
	
	(code)
		name:"reports",
		pattern:"reports/$report(rpt\\d+\\.\\w{3})",
		controller:"report",
		action:"generate_report",
		id:"$report"
		/*
			"server.tld/<appname>/reports/rpt12345.doc"
				controller:"page",
				action:"generate_report",
				report:"rpt12345.doc"
        */
	(end)
	
	The *Request method prefix* can be used to test or capture the method used 
	to submit the web request (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,HEAD). This can be a literal 
	or a variable placeholder.
	
	(code)
		name:"default",
		pattern:"[$method]$controller/$action/$id/$rest*",
		controller:"$controller",
		action:"$action",
		id:"$id",
		method::"$method",
		extraPath:"$rest"
		
		/*
			"server.tld/<appname>/emp/get/22012/pdf"
				controller:"emp",
				action:"get",
				id:"22012",
				method:"GET"
				extraPath:"pdf"
        */
	(end)
	
	
	
Topic: Views
	View Templates are .ejs templates used to render the result of an action. They 
	are stored in app/views. Normally views are loaded automatically for a given controller and 
	action by looking in app/views/<controller name>/<controller_name>_<action_name>.ejs. Views can 
	also be directly rendered via <Controller.render>
	
	There are also two specialized kinds of view files: <Layouts> and <Elements>. 
	Generally <Layouts> wrap view templates, and view templates include <Elements>
	
	Views <Layouts> and <Elements> have access to several global properties 
	
	View Properties:
		$controller					- 	A reference to the controller that called this view
		$model						- 	A reference to this controllers default model, may be null
		$params						- 	A reference to the params of the most recent action
		$page							- 	A reference to this controller's <Controller.$page> property
		getElement					- 	A reference to <getElement>
		[data properties]			- 	All of the calling controller's <Controller.data> 
											properties are available as global variables
		[$FP.helpers classes]	- 	"Html" refers to $FP.helpers.Html, etc
